I" <p>You can deliver location messages to a subset of your MobilePush audience by using the MobilePush SDK. When a mobile device breaks a geofence or comes into proximity of a Bluetooth beacon, the SDK triggers a callback to your mobile app to evaluate whether to show the message.</p>

<p>Your app can apply criteria, including information within the MobilePush message itself, to determine whether to show the message. Here are some use cases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Show the message if the userâ€™s <code class="highlighter-rouge">my store</code> location is within the geofence region.</li>
  <li>Show the message if the user has items in the app shopping cart and if the message has an â€œabandonedCartâ€:â€trueâ€ custom key.</li>
  <li>Show the message only when the store is open based on the appâ€™s store location list and the region and local time.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t show messages if the user isnâ€™t logged in to the app.</li>
  <li>Show specific messages based on the userâ€™s customer profile. For example, customers who are coffee lovers get messages about coffee, but customers who prefer pastry receive a message to â€œadd a coffeeâ€ when theyâ€™re in the shop.</li>
</ul>
