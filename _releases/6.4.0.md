* **JSON Configuration Method Deprecation** -- The `sfmc_configure` and `sfmc_configureWithURL` SDK configuration methods, using the `MarketingCloudSDKConfiguration.json` file, have been deprecated. These methods will be removed in the next SDK release. If you are upgrading to this version of the SDK, see [Configure the SDK]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-started/get-started-configuresdk.html) for an example of using our ConfigBuilder for simple, code-based SDK configuration.

* **Immediate Registration After Install**—To more effectively establish a Marketing Cloud contact, a MobilePush registration will be sent immediately following the first SDK configuration after a new app install. Subsequent registrations will be deferred for up to 60 seconds, as described in [Device and Contact Registration]({{ site.baseurl }}/sdk-implementation/user-data.html).
