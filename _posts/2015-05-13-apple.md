## SDK Configuration Requirements <a name="configuration_requirements"></a>
> If you have already implemented the MobilePush SDK and are upgrading to a new version, you may need to update your configuration to include the *App Endpoint* value, which is a requirement of the SDK beginning in the April, 2019 release.

> Apps configuring the SDK without an *App Endpoint* will result in the SDK returning an error from the configuration method. The SDK will _not_ function if an error is returned from the configuration method.

#### App Endpoint (Tenant Specific Endpoint)
Your application must use the Marketing Cloud's **App Endpoint** value as part of the SDK configuration.

This value is set as the `marketing_cloud_server_url` (JSON configuration) or passed to `sfmc_setMarketingCloudServerUrl()` (builder method).

#### Access Token

This value is set as the `accesstoken` (JSON configuration) or passed to `sfmc_setAccessToken()` (builder method).

#### App ID

This value is set as the `appid` (JSON configuration) or passed to `sfmc_setApplicationId()` (builder method).

#### Obtaining Configuration Values

Configuration values are show in the Marketing Cloud's MobilePush app administration panel.

## 1. Provision your app with Apple

1. Provision your mobile app in your Apple developer account.
2. To integrate the MarketingCloudSDK with your iOS mobile app and enable push notifications, follow [Apple’s Xcode instructions](http://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devdfd3d04a1).

> The APNS (push) certificate issued when you provision your app is valid for one year. To keep the ability to send push notifications, renew the APNS certificate annually before it expires. To create or renew certificates, follow [Apple’s Xcode instructions](http://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev11b059073?sub=dev2178d70ae).

> If you aren’t using Xcode’s Automatically Manage Signing, ensure that you create a provisioning profile in your Apple Developer account for your new app. These settings may vary depending on your testing and distribution needs; at a minimum, you need a valid provisioning profile to send push messages through your app.

## 2. Create your app in Marketing Cloud

To connect your iOS app to Marketing Cloud, create a MobilePush app in MobilePush in Marketing Cloud. This connection allows your app to use MobilePush to communicate with your users via push notifications. Marketing Cloud classifies MobilePush apps as consumer-grade applications. MobilePush apps use long-lived limited-access tokens.

Follow these steps to create a new MobilePush app:
1. Log in to Marketing Cloud.
1. From the Mobile Studio menu, choose MobilePush.
1. On the Administration page, click **Create New App** in the upper right corner.
1. Enter the name and description for the app.
1. Click **Choose file** and upload the icon for the MobilePush app.
1. To upload an APNS certificate, click **Change** and choose the certificate on your computer to upload. Enter the password for the certificate.
  > To create or renew APNS (push) certificates, follow [Apple's Xcode instructions](http://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev11b059073).

1. Make any applicable changes to the optional settings.
1. Click **Save**.

Review [MobilePush documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=mc_mp_provisioning_info.htm&type=5) for more information.

## 3. Implement the SDK

To implement the MarketingCloudSDK framework in your application, either use CocoaPods or manually set up the SDK.

### Option 1: Implement the SDK with CocoaPods

1. Follow the [CocoaPods instructions](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) using MarketingCloudSDK as a dependency in the podfile.
1. Download the following JSON file and add it to your application project in Xcode.  You *must* select "Copy items if needed".
  ><a href="/assets/MarketingCloudSDKConfiguration.json" download>MarketingCloudSDKConfiguration.json</a>
1. Open the .xcworkspace created by the install process with Xcode and start using the SDK.
  > Do **NOT** open .xcodeproj. An error occurs if you open up a project file instead of a workspace.

### Option 2: Implement the SDK manually

1. [Download the SDK](https://github.com/salesforce-marketingcloud/MarketingCloudSDK-iOS).
1. Copy the MarketingCloudSDK directory from your downloads to your project directory.
<br/>
<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/SDKConfigure1.png" /><br/>
1. Open your application project and select the appropriate target.
<br/>
<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/SDKConfigure2.png" /><br/>
1. Add MarketingCloudSDK.framework to Linked Frameworks and Libraries in your target’s General settings.
<br/>
<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/SDKConfigure3.png" /><br/>
1. Add MarketingCloudSDK.bundle to Copy Bundle Resources in your target’s Build Phases settings.
<br/>
<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/SDKConfigure4.png" /><br/>
1. Add -ObjC to your target’s Other Linker Flags build settings.
<br/>
<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/SDKConfigure5.png" /><br/>
  > Review [additional information](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1490/_index.html) from Apple about this linker flag.

## 4. Configure the SDK

> See the SDK header MarketingCloudSDK/MarketingCloudSDK+Base.h ([AppleDoc](https://salesforce-marketingcloud.github.io/MarketingCloudSDK-iOS/appledoc/Classes/MarketingCloudSDK.html)) for alternate configuration methods.

Configure the MarketingCloudSDK framework via a JSON file that you add to your application. This file contains the parameters unique to your application and feature needs. The MarketingCloudSDK framework reads the values in this file and completes its configuration based on these settings.

> All method names contain the prefix `sfmc_`. This convention allows the application implementing the SDK to avoid namespace collisions between the external libraries it uses. MarketingCloudSDK does not cause compile, link, or runtime collisions with other code your application implements. Review Apple’s [documentation on customizing existing classes](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/CustomizingExistingClasses/CustomizingExistingClasses.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210-CH6-SW4) for further information.

1. Add MarketingCloudSDKConfiguration.json to Copy Bundle Resources in your target's Build Phases settings.<br/><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/SDKConfigure6.png" /><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/f7f01542bc24c2a5cfce1a12a8b4e18d.js"></script>
2. Change the `appid` and `accesstoken` values to match the information from your Marketing Cloud account when you configured your application. These values represent the unique pairing of this iOS application with the Marketing Cloud account used for MobilePush.
3. Change the `marketing_cloud_server_url` value to match information from your Marketing Cloud account when you configured your application. This value represents the server to which the SDK will communicate.<br/><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/setupConfigValues.png" /><br/>
4. Change the `mid` value to match information from your Marketing Cloud account when you configured your application. Select your account name in the upper-right corner of the [MobilePush Administration site](https://mc.exacttarget.com/cloud/#app/MobilePush/MobilePush/) and copy the "MID" value (numbers only).<br/><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/setupMidValues.png" /><br/>
1. Enable or disable `etanalytics`, `pianalytics`, `location`, or `inbox` entries depending on the unique needs of your application and your usage of Marketing Cloud.


## 5. Implement Push


1. To implement push notification handling in your application, ensure that you created an APNS Push Certificate in the Apple developer portal and added it to your Marketing Cloud account. Make sure that you added the push notifications feature to your application in the Apple developer portal. Enable push notifications in your target’s Capabilities settings.
<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/SDKConfigure8.png" /><br/>
1. In your application delegate, import the framework header to enable MarketingCloudSDK functionality.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1fd881bd6bd0b81fc53fac4763d758ba.js"></script>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/e98010d99755e03fa470b7f6bea2522e.js"></script>
1. In your application delegate class, add the following sections of code to ensure that your application registers for and handles push notifications. Set your `AppDelegate` class to adhere to the `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` protocol.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/de3ba047a63c27ec8d88fc8e6eaa4f5d.js"></script>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/88c8b6247e1e1cdce48a19dc0c19e304.js"></script>
1. In your application delegate method `-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`, create an instance of the MarketingCloudSDK and configure it for use, setting the push delegate and requesting push authorization. Only configure in didFinishingLaunching.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/sfmc-mobilepushsdk/9adf5dafa2ef98c9484aaa7a66d7668b.js"></script>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/sfmc-mobilepushsdk/5aabbd1337fab819109e427460e26ec7.js"></script>

  > To configure the iOS MarketingCloudSDK, make a call to `sfmc_configure`. The configuration is synchronously performed and blocks the calling thread. To verify successful configuration, check both the return value and the `error` value. See the MarketingCloudSDK+Base.h header file for additional configuration methods.

  > Review the `MarketingCloudSDK+Base.h` header file for additional methods for configuration.

  > Add the required delegate methods to support push notifications to your AppDelegate class.

  > These methods use MarketingCloudSDK methods to enable the framework’s functionality to manage push notifications, which includes MobilePush contact registration and push analytics tracking.

  > If you implement the following methods without using the MarketingCloudSDK methods as shown, MobilePush functionality does not work as expected. If you don’t implement the methods below, MobilePush functionality **does not** work as expected.
