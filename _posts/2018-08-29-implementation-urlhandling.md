The SDK doesnâ€™t automatically present URLs from these sources.
* CloudPage URLs from push notifications
* OpenDirect URLs from push notifications
* CloudPage URLs from inbox messages using the built-in `UITableView` delegate

To handle URLs from these sources, follow these instructions.

1. Implement the `URLHandlingDelegate` (v8.x) or `MarketingCloudSDKURLHandlingDelegate` (v7.x) protocol in your app.
2. Use the `sfmc_setURLHandlingDelegate:` method to set a delegate for this protocol.

The `URLHandlingDelegate` (v8.x) or `MarketingCloudSDKURLHandlingDelegate` (v7.x) is set using `sfmc_setURLHandlingDelegate:` method. This enforces the protocol method `sfmc_handleURL:type:`. When an OpenDirect or CloudPage push notification is received, the SDK passes an `NSURL` value to `sfmc_handleURL:type:`. This value contains the push notification or inbox message, and includes the URL. A type value also reflects the source of the URL, which is either `SFMCURLTypeCloudPage` or `SFMCURLTypeOpenDirect`.

> The class that implements the `URLHandlingDelegate` (v8.x) or `MarketingCloudSDKURLHandlingDelegate` (v7.x) delegate must be Objective-C compatible.

> See `MarketingCloudSDK+URLHandling.h` for more information.
