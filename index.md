## MobilePush SDK: Important Forward-Compatibility Statement

> In early 2024 Marketing Cloud MobilePush SDK support for older iOS versions will be removed from the SDK. Requirements moving forward will be:
> - iOS will require a minimum deployment target of 12.0
> - Xcode 15.0

## iOS 13 Support

> - The MobilePush SDK version 6.4.0 and up has been tested against and is compatible with iOS 13.
> - Our  **LearningApp for iOS** using [CocoaPods](https://github.com/salesforce-marketingcloud/MarketingCloudSDK-iOS/tree/master/LearningApp) and [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/salesforce-marketingcloud/MarketingCloudSDK-iOS/tree/spm/examples/LearningApp) has been tested against and is compatible with iOS 13.
> - Building with XCode11 or greater requires SDK version 5.x or later in order to continue receiving push notifications on iOS 13 devices.

## iOS 14 Support

> - No changes required to support iOS 14 devices.

> - AppTrackingTransparency: Apple introduced a new permission setting called Asking Permission to Track. With iOS 14.5, you must obtain a user’s permission through the AppTrackingTransparency (ATT) framework to access their device’s advertising identifier (IDFA) and track them across multiple apps. By default, MobilePush SDK does not collect IDFAs nor do we use such values to track users across multiple apps. As such, at the moment, there are no changes required for MobilePush customers. If your organization plans to capture IDFA, you must explicitly obtain user’s permission through ATT in your app. To submit this value to the Marketing Cloud, set it as an attribute within the MobilePush SDK.

## iOS Data Protection
> - The MobilePush SDK version 6.4.1 includes new troubleshooting information and code examples to demonstrate proper configuration and usage when iOS Data Protection is in use. See [iOS Data Protection]({{ site.baseurl }}/trouble/trouble-ios-data-protection.html).
> - The  **LearningApp for iOS** using [CocoaPods](https://github.com/salesforce-marketingcloud/MarketingCloudSDK-iOS/tree/master/LearningApp) and [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/salesforce-marketingcloud/MarketingCloudSDK-iOS/tree/spm/examples/LearningApp) has been modified to show proper usage.

## Requirements

## Get Started

1. [Download and set up the SDK]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-started/apple.html)

Set the contact key to a specific value provided by your customer or to another unique identifier for the contact, such as mobile number, email address, customer number, or another value.
    * Add [attributes]({{ site.baseurl }}/sdk-implementation/user-data.html#attributes) and [tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/sdk-implementation/user-data.html#tags) -- Enhance your ability to segment your push message audiences.

### 3rd Party Product Language Disclaimers
Where possible, we changed noninclusive terms to align with our company value of Equality. We retained noninclusive terms to document a third-party system, but we encourage the developer community to embrace more inclusive language. We can update the term when it’s no longer required for technical accuracy.
